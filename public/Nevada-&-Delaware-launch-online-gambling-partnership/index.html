        <h1 id="Nevada-amp-Delaware-launch-online-gambling-partnership"><a href="#Nevada-amp-Delaware-launch-online-gambling-partnership" class="headerlink" title="Nevada &amp; Delaware launch online gambling partnership"></a>Nevada &amp; Delaware launch online gambling partnership</h1><p>On Tuesday, June 25th, Nevada and Delaware became the first states to jointly offer online gambling. This new partnership will allow residents of both states to gamble online on casino games, including poker.</p>
<p>This partnership is seen as a major step forward in the effort to legalize online gambling nationwide. Advocates of online gambling believe that this type of gaming offers many benefits, such as more convenience and increased tourism revenues.</p>
<p>Opponents of online gambling argue that it can be addictive and lead to financial ruin. However, many experts agree that if it is properly regulated, online gambling can be a safe and healthy form of entertainment for adults.</p>
<p>So far, Nevada and Delaware are the only states to have partnered up for online gambling. But it is believed that other states may soon follow suit, as the popularity of this form of gaming continues to grow.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-amp-Nevada-partner-to-offer-interstate-online-gambling"><a href="#New-Jersey-amp-Nevada-partner-to-offer-interstate-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey &amp; Nevada partner to offer interstate online gambling"></a>New Jersey &amp; Nevada partner to offer interstate online gambling</h1><p>In a move that could change the landscape of online gambling, New Jersey and Nevada have announced plans to cooperate in offering interstate gambling.</p>
<p>The two states have entered into an agreement that will allow licensed casinos in each state to offer their games to customers in the other state. This means that residents of Nevada will be able to place bets on Atlantic City’s online casinos, and vice versa.</p>
<p>“This is a very important day for the gaming industry and for people who enjoy playing casino games,” said New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. “We are pleased to be working with the state of Nevada to offer new opportunities for people to engage in legal gambling no matter where they live.”</p>
<p>Interstate gambling has been illegal in the United States since 2011, when the Department of Justice issued a ruling that barred financial institutions from processing payments for online gambling transactions between states. This decision effectively shut down the interstate market for online gambling.</p>
<p>But last year, New Jersey challenged the ruling, arguing that it violated the 10th Amendment of the Constitution, which guarantees states’ rights. In February, a federal appeals court sided with New Jersey, ruling that the Department of Justice’s interpretation of the law was too broad.</p>
<p>This ruling paves the way for New Jersey and Nevada to launch their interstate gambling partnership. Other states are likely to follow suit, as they seek to capitalize on what is expected to be a lucrative market.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-joins-the-online-gambling-fray"><a href="#Pennsylvania-joins-the-online-gambling-fray" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania joins the online gambling fray"></a>Pennsylvania joins the online gambling fray</h1><p>Pennsylvania has become the fourth state in the US to join the legal online gambling fray. This follows New Jersey, Nevada and Delaware, who were among the first to legalize and regulate internet gambling in 2013.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) announced on Wednesday that it will offer three online casino games: slots, blackjack and roulette. Operators must have a physical presence in the state in order to offer online gambling.</p>
<p>“The PGCB is committed to providing an entertaining experience that is safe and secure for our players,” said PGCB Chairman William H. Hart III in a statement. “The launch of our online gaming product is another milestone in our efforts to regulate the industry and ensure that Pennsylvania enjoys the many benefits of this form of gaming.”</p>
<p>There will be a $5 million licensing fee for operators, as well as a 34 percent tax on gross gaming revenue. The minimum age requirement for players is 21 years old.</p>

<h1 id="Michigan-considering-online-gambling-legislation"><a href="#Michigan-considering-online-gambling-legislation" class="headerlink" title="Michigan considering online gambling legislation"></a>Michigan considering online gambling legislation</h1><p>Michigan is the latest state to consider online gambling legislation, as lawmakers look to expand gambling options in the state. The proposed legislation would legalize and regulate online gambling, including casino games, poker, and sports betting.</p>
<p>Supporters of the legislation say that it would bring much-needed revenue to the state. Michigan faces a budget shortfall of more than $1 billion, and supporters argue that legalizing online gambling could help to address that shortfall.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to increased addiction and social problems. They also warn that the state could lose out on revenue if people gamble instead of spending money at Michigan’s casinos.</p>
<p>The proposed legislation has not yet been voted on, but it is expected to face strong opposition in the legislature. If passed, Michigan would join other states such as Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware that have legalized online gambling.</p>
<h1 id="California-gearing-up-to-offer-online-gambling"><a href="#California-gearing-up-to-offer-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="California gearing up to offer online gambling"></a>California gearing up to offer online gambling</h1><p>The State of California is preparing to offer online gambling, following the lead of Nevada and New Jersey. The state’s Gambling Control Commission has voted unanimously to authorize the issuance of up to six online gambling licenses.</p>
<p>The proposed regulations were drawn up by the commission in consultation with the California Department of Justice and the Department of Finance. They include a provision that would require applicants for an online gambling license to be licensed by the state’s casino control board.</p>
<p>The regulations also include a number of consumer protection measures, including requirements that operators ensure that players are at least 21 years old and that they do not gamble more than they can afford to lose. Operators would also be required to give customers information about responsible gambling, including how to self-exclude themselves from gambling activities.</p>
<p>Licensed operators would be allowed to offer games such as poker, blackjack, slots, and roulette, but would not be allowed to offer sports betting. The regulations would also prohibit operators from offering any games that are currently illegal in California, such as bingo or lotteries.</p>
<p>Commission chairman Tony He said that the commission is committed to implementing strong consumer protection measures in order to ensure that Californians have a safe and responsible online gambling experience. “These regulations put California on a path to licensing safe and responsible Internet poker websites that will protect consumers and generate hundreds of millions of dollars for our schools and universities,” he said.</p>
<p>Supporters of online gambling argue that it will generate much-needed revenue for the state’s schools and universities. A study commissioned by the Gambling Control Commission estimated that online gambling could generate as much as $380 million in annual revenue for California schools and universities.</p>
