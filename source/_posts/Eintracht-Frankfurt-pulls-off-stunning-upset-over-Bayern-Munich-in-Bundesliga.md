#  Eintracht Frankfurt pulls off stunning upset over Bayern Munich in Bundesliga

In a stunning upset, Eintracht Frankfurt pulled off a 3-1 victory over Bayern Munich in Bundesliga play on Sunday.

The home side got on the board first in the 34th minute when Sebastien Haller headed in a goal off a cross from Luka Jovic. The teams went into the halftime break with Frankfurt leading 1-0.

In the 58th minute, Jovic doubled the lead for Frankfurt with his own header. Bayern Munich pulled one back in the 69th minute when Robert Lewandowski scored, but Haller sealed the win for Frankfurt with a goal in stoppage time.

The victory moves Frankfurt up to fourth place in the Bundesliga, while Bayern Munich falls to second.

#  How Eintracht Frankfurt's Julian Brandt could be key to their success this season

Eintracht Frankfurt have been one of the surprise packages of the Bundesliga season so far, with Julian Brandt key to their success.

The 21-year-old has been in superb form for the club, scoring five goals and providing six assists in just 15 appearances. This has helped them to sixth place in the table, just two points off the Champions League places.

Brandt joined Eintracht from Bayer Leverkusen in the summer of 2018, and he has quickly become a key player for them. He has shown his quality both in attacking and defensive phases of the game, and this has made him a crucial player for Adi Hutter's side.

One of Brandt's main strengths is his versatility. He can play as a winger, attacking midfielder or central midfielder, which means that he can be used in a number of different positions depending on the game situation.

This flexibility could be crucial for Eintracht this season as they look to qualify for the Champions League. They currently sit in sixth place but are only two points off fourth-placed RB Leipzig, so they will need to maintain their current form if they are to make it into Europe's top club competition.

Brandt is certainly capable of helping them achieve this goal. He is one of the most exciting young players in Europe, and he has already proven himself at the highest level. He was part of Germany's World Cup squad last year, and he will be looking to help Eintracht make a similar impact in the Bundesliga this season.

#  Eintracht Frankfurt staying afloat in Bundesliga after poor start to season

Eintracht Frankfurt have been one of the surprise packages in the Bundesliga this season. After a poor start to the season, they have been able to string together some good results and are now in mid-table.

Some of their key players this season have been Luka Jovic, Sebastien Haller and Ante Rebic. All three players have contributed with goals and assists and have been crucial in their club’s resurgence.

Despite their good form, there are still some areas that need improvement. Their defence has been leaky at times and they will need to tighten up if they want to stay in contention for a European spot.

Their next match is against Schalke 04, who are also in good form. It is going to be a difficult match for Frankfurt, but they will be hoping to get all three points and continue their push up the table.

#  Bold move by Eintracht Frankfurt nets them much-needed win over Bayer Leverkusen

Eintracht Frankfurt made a statement of intent on Sunday, beating Bundesliga giants Bayer Leverkusen 3-1. The win was much-needed for Niko Kovac's side, who have had a difficult start to the season and were languishing in the bottom three prior to this match.

Leverkusen took the lead early on through Kai Havertz, but Frankfurt hit back before half-time through Sebastien Haller. Second-half goals from Luka Jovic and substitute Mijat Gacinovic secured all three points for the home side.

The result moves Frankfurt up to tenth in the table and will give them confidence ahead of important matches against Freiburg and Schalke in the coming weeks. Leverkusen, meanwhile, remain in third place but have now dropped six points in their last four games.

#  Eintracht Frankfurt hoping for strong finish to unforgettable season

Eintracht Frankfurt are looking to end their Bundesliga season on a high note, after an incredible year which has seen them competing in the Europa League semi-finals.

The club have had a memorable campaign and they will be looking to finish it with a flourish by picking up some wins in their final six league games.

They currently sit in fifth place in the table, just two points behind fourth-placed Bayer Leverkusen, and there is still everything to play for as they look to secure a spot in next season’s Champions League.

Their first game of the run-in sees them take on Fortuna Dusseldorf, who are currently bottom of the Bundesliga, and they will be confident of picking up all three points.

Die Adler then face Hertha Berlin, who occupy the final relegation spot, before taking on Hoffenheim, Werder Bremen, VFB Stuttgart and RB Leipzig.

Eintracht Frankfurt have been one of the surprise packages of the Bundesliga this season and they will be determined to finish the campaign on a high note.
