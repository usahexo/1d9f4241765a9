Slot machines come in all shapes and sizes and this little antique slot machine is perfect for those who want the excitement of a slot machine but don't have a lot of money to spend. It's small enough to fit almost anywhere and yet it's packed with features that will keep you entertained for hours.

This Slot Machine is definitely an antique piece, circa early 1800s. It was my Grandfathers and I remember playing on it as a child. The great thing about this Slot Machine is that even though it is small, it has all the features of a regular sized Slot Machine. You can still play 3 lines at a time and the maximum bet is only $2.00 which makes it great for those on a budget.

One downside to this Slot Machine is that it doesn't have a progressive jackpot, but with such a low max bet, it really isn't necessary. This Slot Machine also comes with built in speakers so you can really get into the action without having to worry about disturbing anyone else in the house. Overall, I highly recommend this Slot Machine for anyone looking for some affordable fun.
