#  How to make a blackjack card sneaker Brescia 

In this tutorial we will show you how to make a blackjack card sneaker.

What you need:
- Black and white leather
- Scissors
- Pencil
- Ruler
- nail scissors
- Hot glue gun 
- Black shoe paint  
- Paintbrush 
- Awl 



 1) Draw the outline of your shoe on the black leather using a pencil. Make sure that the sides are slightly curved for a better fit. You can find a template online or in a book on shoemaking, or simply trace an existing pair of shoes. Cut out the shape with scissors.



 2) Next, cut out two identical pieces of white leather in the shape of the shoe. The easiest way to do this is to lay one piece of black leather on top of the other piece of white leather and trace around it with a pencil. Be careful not to press down too hard with the pencil, or you'll end up cutting through both pieces of leather at once! Cut out the shape with scissors.



 3) Place one piece of white leather on top of the black leather, matching up all the edges. Use a ruler and nail scissors to trim off any excess white leather so that they fit perfectly together. Use a hot glue gun to attach them together.



 4) Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the other shoe.



 5) Once both shoes are glued together, use a black shoe paint to paint over the entire surface. You may need to apply several coats for complete coverage. Let dry between coats. Once dry, use a brush to brush off any excess paint that may have gotten on neighboring surfaces. Let dry completely before using.

#  How to make a blackjack card shoe Brescia 

There are a few different ways to make a blackjack card shoe. You can buy them pre-made, or you can make them yourself.

The easiest way to make a blackjack card shoe is to buy one pre-made. There are a few different types and styles of pre-made card shoes available, so you can choose the one that best suits your needs.

If you want to make your own card shoe, there are a few different methods you can use. One popular method is to use a flower pot. To do this, you'll need a small flower pot (around 4 inches in diameter), some foamcore board, spray adhesive, and hot glue. First, spray the foamcore board with adhesive and then wrap it around the flower pot. Glue the edges of the foamcore board together and let dry. You can then attach the cards to the top of the foamcore board using hot glue.

Another method for making your own blackjack card shoe is to use a PVC pipe. To do this, you'll need a PVC pipe (any size will work, but 6 inches in diameter is ideal), some PVC cement, sandpaper, and paint (optional). First, sand down the outside surface of the PVC pipe until it's smooth. Then, paint the pipe (optional). Once the paint is dry, apply a coat of PVC cement to one end of the pipe and attach the other end shut with duct tape. You can then attach the cards to the top of the pipe using clothespins or magnets.

#  How to make a blackjack card sandal Brescia
Heel
The modern sandal has been traced back to ancient Egyptian times. They were made from papyrus and were used by both men and women. The ancient Greeks and Romans also wore sandals, mostly made from straw or leather. Next, the Chinese are credited with making the first wooden clogs in the 10th century.
From there, sandals began to be made from a variety of materials such as cloth, silk, velvet, suede, and even sheepskin. They ranged in style from simple thongs to elaborate designs that covered the entire foot. In the 1930s, the modern high heel sandal was born with the invention of the stiletto heel.

Today’s sandals can be traced back to these early designs, but with a more contemporary flair. There are now myriad styles to choose from, including flip-flops, gladiator sandals, Birkenstocks®, and more. And with summer just around the corner, it’s time to start thinking about how you want your toes to look when hitting the beach or pool this year.
If you’re in need of some inspiration for this season’s hottest sandal trend, look no further than the blackjack card heel Brescia heel. Named for its resemblance to a playing card, this sultry sandal will add an air of sophistication to any outfit. Featuring a T-bar design with a crossover strap detail and small block heel, this style is perfect for dressing up or down.

To make your own blackjack card sandal Brescia heel, you will need: 
-A pair of shoes with a T-bar design and crossover strap detail 
-1/2 inch - 3/4 inch closed toe pleather or vinyl in black 
-Hot glue gun 
-Scissors 
-Ruler 
-Pencil 
-Paintbrush (optional) 
Step 1: Cut out two pieces of pleather or vinyl that are each 2 inches wide by 12 inches long. These will be used for the straps on your sandals. Step 2: Mark where the straps will go on your shoes using a ruler and pencil. The straps should go across the middle of the T-bar design and curve around to meet in the back. Make sure to mark where both straps will attach on both shoes since they will be mirror images of each other. Step 3: Cut small slits at each mark where you will be attaching the straps using scissors. Be careful not to cut through the material completely – you only want to make small cuts so that you can fold them over later without having raw edges showing. Step 4: Glue one end of each strap onto the shoe using a hot glue gun. Make sure that they are glued on securely in place before moving on to step 5. Step 5: Curl each strap around so that it meets in back and forms a loop shape like in the photo above (or see video tutorial below). If needed, trim any excess material so that everything is neat and tidy looking once it’s all glued in place . Step 6: Glue each folded strap down onto the shoe using a hot glue gun . Hold them down securely until they cool and set in place . Voilà! You have now created your very own blackjack card heel Brescia sandal!

#  How to make a blackjack card pump

Hey there everyone! Today I am going to show you how to make a blackjack card pump. This is a great little project that you can do in an hour or two, and it only requires a few basic supplies. So without further ado, let’s get started!

The first thing you will need is a piece of cardboard. You can use any kind of cardboard, but for this project I would recommend using something sturdy like corrugated cardboard.

Next, you will need some tape. I would recommend using a strong tape like duct tape or gorilla tape.

Finally, you will need some scissors and a pen or pencil.

Alright, let’s get started! The first thing you want to do is draw out your design on the cardboard. This can be any design that you want, but I have included a template below that you can use if you are not sure what to draw.

Once you have drawn out your design, use the scissors to cut it out. Be very careful when cutting out the small details, as this can be tricky.

Next, take the piece of cardboard and fold it in half so that the two sides match up. Then use the tape to secure the two sides together.

Now it’s time to make the pump mechanism! This is where things get a bit tricky, so pay close attention. Take one of the ends of the CARDBOARD TUBE and insert it into the slit that you made in the center of your cardstock. It should fit snugly inside. Now take the other end of the CARDBOARD TUBE and insert it into the other slit that you made in the center of your cardstock. Again, it should fit snugly inside.





















         Mode Of Operation: Blackjack pumps are operated by pushing down on both ends of the tubing at once; each side then has an individual plunger which returns automatically as soon as pressure is released
