#  How to Play the Secret Agent Game – a guide for beginners!

Do you want to pretend to be a secret agent? If so, then the Secret Agent Game is perfect for you! This game is easy to play, and perfect for beginners. In this article, we will teach you how to play the game.

The Secret Agent Game is all about espionage and secrecy. In this game, players must complete missions in order to win. Each mission is assigned a point value, and the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

To play the game, you will need a deck of cards, some pencils and paper, and a way to keep track of points (like a scoreboard or spreadsheet). The game can be played with anywhere from 2-10 players.

The dealer will start by dealing 7 cards to each player. The remaining cards are placed in the middle of the players, face down. Players will then take turns flipping over one card at a time from the middle of the table. When a player flips over a card that matches one of their own cards, they must place their card face down in front of them. If they flip over a card that does not match any of their own cards, they must put it back into the middle of the table and continue flipping over cards.

When a player flips over a card that matches one of their own cards, they can either claim the mission for that card or wait for later in the game when they have more matching cards to combine into sets and claim multiple missions at once. When claiming a mission, the player must write down the name of the mission on their sheet of paper, as well as how many points it is worth. The player then puts their card back into the deck and draws another card from the deck to replace it.

If at any time all but one player has no cards left in their hand, that player automatically wins! Otherwise, when all cards have been flipped over and there are no more matches, the player with the most points wins!
