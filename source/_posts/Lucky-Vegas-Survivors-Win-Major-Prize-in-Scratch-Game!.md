#  Lucky Vegas Survivors Win Major Prize in Scratch Game!

Las Vegas, Nevada – With the odds of one in 292,201,338 of winning the Mega Millions jackpot, residents in and around Las Vegas were feeling lucky on Friday night. So when news broke of a $1 billion prize being won by a group of ten friends, many residents headed to local convenience stores to also try their luck on the $2 Scratch game.

Sadly for most, the big win was not meant to be. But for three lucky survivors, their $10 investment resulted in a prize worth $100,000 each!

“I still can’t believe it,” said 33-year-old Crystal Garcia. “I was so sure that the ticket was a loser. I mean, who wins $100,000 on a scratch game? But when I checked the numbers online and saw that I’d actually matched all six winning numbers, I couldn’t believe it!”

Garcia was one of three people in the area to win the top prize on Friday night. The other two winners have chosen to remain anonymous.

According to store employees, Garcia and the other two winners all bought tickets at different stores in the area. Garcia purchased her ticket at Quickie Mart #9 while the other two winners bought their tickets at Valero #767 and 7-Eleven #15946 respectively.

When asked what she planned to do with her newfound wealth, Garcia replied that she was still trying to wrap her head around it all. “But I think I might take my family on a nice vacation somewhere tropical. We could use some time away from the cold weather!”

When gunfire erupted on the Las Vegas Strip on October 1, 2017, some people ran for their lives. Others cowered in place or took cover.

Then there were those who instinctively grabbed their phones and started filming. Some captured video of the gunman as he sprayed the crowd with bullets from his perch on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.

Others recorded clips of themselves or others reacting to the gunfire in a state of near-panic.

Less than two weeks after the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, three casino-goers who survived the massacre won $10,000 each playing a scratch game at the Plaza Hotel and Casino in downtown Las Vegas. 

The three winners, who were not identified, were playing a game called “ Win Momentum ” when they each revealed three matching symbols that won them $10,000 each, said Tony Hsieh , CEO of Downtown Project, which operates the Plaza. 

Hsieh said he was glad to see casino-goers being rewarded for surviving a traumatic event and hoped it would bring some positive news to the city during a difficult time .
