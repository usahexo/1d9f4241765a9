#  Nevada Leads the Country in Gambling Internet Casinos

Nevada is the clear front runner when it comes to gambling internet casinos. The state has over two hundred such establishments, which is more than twice as many as any other state.

Most of Nevada's gambling internet casinos are located in the Las Vegas area. This is not surprising, given that Las Vegas is already well-known for its numerous gambling establishments. In fact, the city has been called the "Gambling Capital of the World."

Some people might be surprised to learn that Nevada also has a significant number of tribal gambling casinos. These casinos are located on Native American reservations and offer a variety of traditional casino games, such as blackjack, craps, and roulette.

Interestingly, not all of Nevada's gambling internet casinos are operated by businesses entities. There are also a number of websites that allow residents of the state to gamble online from their homes. These websites operate in a legal grey area, but they continue to be popular among Nevadans.

So why is Nevada so heavily invested in gambling internet casinos? One reason may be that the state has struggled economically in recent years. Gambling revenue can help to offset some of these financial woes.

Another reason may be that Nevadans simply enjoy gambling and want easy access to casino games online. Whatever the reasons may be, it's clear that Nevada is leading the country in gambling internet casinos.

#  California Struggles to Keep Up with Neighboring Nevada

California has been a leading state in the US for many years. However, neighboring Nevada is catching up quickly.

Las Vegas, Nevada has been growing rapidly in population and economy. This can be seen in its rising GDP and job growth rates. While California’s GDP growth rate has been slowing in recent years, Nevada’s has been consistently increasing.

This development is changing the economic landscape of the region. With California no longer being the clear leader, businesses are starting to move their operations to Las Vegas. This is especially true in the technology sector, as Silicon Valley becomes too expensive for businesses to operate in.

The rise of Las Vegas is also hurting California’s real estate market. As businesses move out of Silicon Valley, housing prices are dropping. In fact, San Jose and San Francisco are now two of the most affordable major cities in the US.

Despite these challenges, California still has many advantages over Nevada. Its population is much larger, and it has a more diversified economy. California also has a better infrastructure and higher-quality schools.

Ultimately, California will need to make some significant changes if it wants to remain the top state in the region.

#  Delaware Makes Huge Strides in Gambling Internet Casinos

Delaware casino regulators reported this week that the state’s internet gambling industry is booming, with overall revenue up sharply since last year.

In figures released on Monday, the regulator said gross revenues from internet gambling had reached $17.5m in the first 10 months of the year - a jump of more than 50% on the same period in 2016.

The increase has been helped by new games and providers entering the Delaware market, as well as rising interest in online gambling among players.

While brick and mortar casinos continue to account for the lion’s share of gambling revenue in Delaware - pulling in $236.5m in the first 10 months of 2017 - internet gambling is seen as an important growth engine for the industry.

Delaware was one of the first states to legalize online gambling, launching its regulated market in 2013. At present, just two companies are licensed to offer internet casino games in Delaware - Dover Downs Hotel & Casino and Delaware Park Hotel & Casino - but that is expected to change soon.

In September, Pennsylvania became the fourth US state to legalize online casinos, with regulations due to come into force next year. That is likely to see more operators enter the Delaware market, as they seek to expand their reach beyond their home state markets.

#  New York Opens Up First of Its Kind Online Casino

The New York State Gaming Commission has announced the opening of a new online casino, the first of its kind in the state.

The casino, which is called NY Casino and is run by the gaming commission, will offer residents of New York State the chance to gamble on their computer or mobile device from anywhere in the state.

“This is an exciting day for New Yorkers who love to gamble,” said Gaming Commission Chairman Karl Johnson. “We are proud to offer our residents a safe and legal place to bet on their favorite games.”

NY Casino will offer a range of popular casino games, including blackjack, poker, and slots. Players will be able to place bets starting at $0.01 and up to $100 per spin.

In order to ensure that players have a safe and enjoyable experience, the casino will limit how much money players can spend in a day. Players will also be able to set limits on how much money they can lose in a day.

In addition, all games at NY Casino are subject to rigorous testing by independent auditors to ensure that they are fair and reliable.

NY Casino is available now for desktop and mobile devices. For more information or to start playing, visit nycasino.com.

#  Pennsylvania and Maryland Vie for Title of Gambling Internet Capital

The race to become the gambling capital of the internet is heating up, with Pennsylvania and Maryland both making strong cases for themselves.

Pennsylvania has been a hotbed of online gambling activity in recent years, with numerous operators establishing their presence in the state. Major brands like PokerStars, partypoker, and 888poker are all active in Pennsylvania’s regulated online poker market, while other gaming verticals like slots and casino games are also well represented.

Maryland has been a little slower to embrace online gambling, but that could soon change. Earlier this year, the state legalized sports betting and hinted that it may soon follow suit on other forms of internet gambling. With a population of over 6 million people and a thriving casino industry, Maryland is certainly well positioned to make a run at becoming the king of online gambling.

So who will win this race? It’s hard to say for sure, but both states have plenty going for them. In the end, it may come down to which state can offer the best gaming experience and attract the most players.
