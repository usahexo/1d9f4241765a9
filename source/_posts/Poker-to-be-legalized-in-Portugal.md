#  Poker to be legalized in Portugal

Lawmakers in Portugal are preparing to legalize poker, as the country looks to join other European nations in regulating the popular card game.

The proposed legislation, which is still in its early stages, would establish a licensing system for both online and land-based poker clubs. The bill also includes restrictions on who can play, barring those under the age of 18 and prohibiting players from organizing games among themselves.

Public support for regulated poker is strong in Portugal, with a recent survey showing that 73% of respondents favor legalization. This is likely due to the fact that regulated poker offers a number of consumer protections, such as age restrictions and responsible gambling measures.

Given the overwhelming public support, it's likely that the Portuguese legislature will pass a bill regulating poker in the near future. This would make Portugal one of the most gaming-friendly countries in Europe, joining Gibraltar, Malta and the United Kingdom in offering a safe and regulated environment for poker players.

#  Portugal to follow in Nevada's footsteps and legalize Poker

Portugal is close to following in Nevada's footsteps and legalize Poker.

The Portuguese parliament is discussing a bill that would regulate and tax Poker, according to local media reports. The proposed bill would create a licensing system for online and land-based Poker operators, and allow licenses to be granted to both companies and private individuals.

amidst waning global interest in traditional sports, Portugal's lawmakers are apparently looking for new sources of revenue, and it looks like they've set their sights on legalized Poker. Alexandre Braga, the lawmaker who sponsored the bill, believes that regulated Poker could bring in around €50 million ($57 million) in annual revenue.

If the bill is successful, Portugal will join a small group of countries that have legalized and regulated modern Poker. In addition to Nevada, only Australia, France, Italy, and Spain have fully legalized the game. Several other countries, including Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Mexico, Poland, Romania and Sweden have adopted more limited versions of legalization.

#  Portugal's decision to legalize poker could lead to significant economic boost

#
On July 1, 2017, Portugal's new gambling law went into effect, legalizing poker and other card games. The new law is expected to lead to a significant economic boost for the country, as well as create jobs and attract foreign investment.

#
Portugal has seen a decline in its casino industry in recent years, as neighboring countries such as Spain and France have legalized gambling. The new law is hoped to reverse this trend and bring in much-needed revenue to the country.

#
Some proponents of the law believe that it could also help to reduce crime rates in Portugal. As illegal poker games are often associated with organized crime, legalizing the game could help to reduce criminal activity.

#
At present, it is estimated that the Portuguese poker market is worth around €250 million per year. This figure is expected to grow significantly following the legalization of the game.

While there are some concerns that the new law could lead to an increase in problem gambling, most experts believe that it will ultimately have a positive impact on the country's economy.
