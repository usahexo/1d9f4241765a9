#  What is the company's history and how did it come to be in the online gaming industry?

The company was founded in the early 1990s by John and Patriciaum D. Romero, two industry veterans who had worked on games such as Commander Keen, Wolfenstein 3D, and Doom. They started the company with the intention of developing new video games for personal computers.

In 1992, the company released its first game, a shooter called Hovertank 3D. The game was not a commercial success, but it helped the company to attract attention from other developers in the industry.

In 1994, id Software released its most popular game to date: Doom. The game was a critical and commercial success, and it helped to popularize the first-person shooter genre.

Following Doom's release, id Software was acquired by ZeniMax Media. The company has remained under ZeniMax Media's ownership since then.

Over the years, id Software has developed a number of popular video games, including Quake, Rage, and Wolfenstein: The New Order.
