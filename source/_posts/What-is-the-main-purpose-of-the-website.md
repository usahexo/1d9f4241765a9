#  How often is the website updated?

This is an important question to ask before you start working with or developing a website. It can be the difference between a site that’s current and up-to-date and one that’s neglected and in disrepair.

Ideally, you want to find a website that’s updated on at least a weekly basis if not more frequently than that. If it’s been a while since the site has been updated, it may be a sign that the owner isn’t interested in keeping it current any longer. This can mean that outdated information is still displayed on the website or worse, that the site is no longer being maintained at all.

Of course, there are always exceptions to this rule. If the site is brand new, for example, it may not have had time to be updated yet. Or if it’s a niche website with infrequent updates, that may be okay too as long as the content is high quality. But in general, you should steer clear of sites that haven’t been updated in months (or years) and make sure to check the date of last update on each page before you settle on using it as your source of information.

#  Is the website open to public submissions?

If you're asking whether or not the website accepts submissions from the general public, the answer is usually no. Most websites that accept article submissions require you to apply for contributor status and be approved by the editorial team before your content is published.

However, there are a few exceptions to this rule. Some websites allow anyone to submit articles without prior approval, while others have an open submission policy but only publish a limited number of pieces from non-contributors each month.

So, if you're looking tosubmit an article to a website, the best thing to do isread their Submission Guidelines page first to see if they accept submissions from the public. If they don't, then you can try submitting your article to one of the websites that do.
